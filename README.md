AirBnB Clone Project

This project is an AirBnB clone, built using Python and Flask. It is a web-based platform that allows users to list and book properties, similar to the original AirBnB website. The project includes both a web-based front-end and a back-end database, which stores property and booking data.

Features
The AirBnB clone includes the following features:

- User authentication
- Booking
- Payment processing
- Property listing
- Property search

Getting Started
To get started with the AirBnB clone project, you will need to:

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies, including Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.
- Set up the database using the provided script.
- Start the Flask development server to run the web application.

How to use it
Once the project is set up, users can interact with the web-based platform by navigating to the appropriate URL in their web browser. From there, they can create an account, log in, search for properties, and book properties as desired.

To use the command interpreter, users can run the console.py script from the command line, and then execute commands as desired.

Examples

- show User: display all users in the database
- create City name="Lagos": create a new city with the name "Lagos"
- update User 12345 first_name="John" last_name="Doe": update the first and last name of the user with ID 12345 to "John Doe"
- destroy Amenity 54321: delete the amenity with ID 54321 from the database
